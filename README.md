# Lazysort

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/rust-lazysort.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/rust-lazysort)

Adds a method to iterators that returns a sorted iterator over the data.  The sorting is achieved lazily using a quicksort algorithm.

Available via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lazysort).

Requires a recent Rust 0.13 nightly build.

## Usage

```rust
extern crate lazysort;

use lazysort::Sorted;

use lazysort::SortedBy;
```

The `Sorted` trait adds a method `sorted` to all `Iterator<T: Ord>` which returns an iterator over the same data in default order.

The `SortedBy` trait adds a method `sorted_by` to all `Iterator<T>` which returns an iterator over the same data ordered according to the provided closure of type `|T, T| -> Ordering`

For example:

```rust
let data: Vec<uint> = vec![9, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 4];
for x in data.iter().sorted() {
	println!("{}", x);
}
```

Will print: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 9

## Implementation details and performance

The algorithm is essentially the same as described in my blog post [using a lazy sort as an example of Clojure's lazy sequences](http://benashford.github.io/blog/2014/03/22/the-power-of-lazy-sequences/).  But made to fit in with Rust's iterators.

The full sequence from the parent iterator is read, then each call to `next` returns the next value in the sorted sequence.  The sort is done element-by-element so the full order is only realised by iterating all the way through to the end.

Previous versions did not use an in-place sort, in keeping as they were with Clojure's immutable data-structures.  The latest version however does sort in-place.

To summarise, the algorithm is the classic quicksort, but essentially depth-first; upon each call to `next` it does the work necessary to find the next item then pauses the state until the next call to `next`.

Because of the overhead to track state, using this approach to sort a full vector is slower than the `sort` function from the standard library:

```
test tests::c_lazy_bench     ... bench:   7264361 ns/iter (+/- 273508)
test tests::c_standard_bench ... bench:   2996623 ns/iter (+/- 86006)
```

These benchmarks are for sorting 50,000 random `uint`s in the range 0 <= x < 1000000.  Run `cargo bench` to run them.

So what's the point of lazy sorting?  As per the linked blog post, they're useful when you do not need or intend to need every value; for example you may only need the first 1,000 ordered values from a larger set.

Comparing the lazy approach `data.iter().sorted().take(x)` vs a standard approach of sorting a vector then taking the first `x` values gives the following.

The first 1,000 out of 50,000:

```
test tests::a_lazy_bench     ... bench:    906559 ns/iter (+/- 847740)
test tests::a_standard_bench ... bench:   2885885 ns/iter (+/- 570331)
```

The lazy approach is quite a bit faster; this is due to the 50,000 only being sorted enough to identify the first 1,000, the rest remain unsorted.

The first 10,000 out of 50,000:

```
test tests::b_lazy_bench     ... bench:   2217510 ns/iter (+/- 680408)
test tests::b_standard_bench ... bench:   2891829 ns/iter (+/- 54678)
```

The lazy approach is still faster, slightly.

These results change on a regular basis as Rust is a fast-moving target, run `cargo bench` to see for yourself the latest numbers.  Earlier versions of Rust had the performance more closely matched, but the latest nightlies have a wider gap; the performance of lazysort has improved with the latest builds, but the performance of the built-in sort has improved even more.
